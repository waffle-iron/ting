Running Ting
============
1. git clone
2. Set up a MySQL database
3. Make a copy of `config/common.json` into `config/local.json` and add your
   settings.
4. Install node package manager and the dependencies required to run Django 
   installation by running `sudo apt-get install python-dev libmysqlclient-dev
   libffi-dev python-pip npm`.
5. Make a virtual python environment using `virtualenv venv` on the API/ folder.
   We recommend this because the API will use its own copies of python and of the
   required dependencies, so you can update your libraries in your system
   without worrying that you might "break" the API.
   In order to use the virtual environment you only have to run `source venv/bin/activate`
   when you want to run python or pip. To deactivate it you can just run `deactivate`
   or close the terminal.
6. Run `pip install MySQL-python`.
7. Go to API/  and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies of 
   Django server.
8. Run the Django server using `python manage.py runserver` inside the `API`
   folder. If it asks you to run migrations, do it.
9. Install bower by running `sudo npm install -g bower`.
   Install the required dependencies for the node server and the client by
   running `npm install` in client/ and realtime/. Then `bower install` in client/.
   (Please note that some dependencies like bower or gulp may not be working through 
   the absolute path so `PATH=$(npm bin):$PATH` should solve the problem.)
10. Run the node service using `node server.js` or `forever start server.js` inside the
   `realtime` folder.
11. Build the client-side bundle with `gulp browserify` inside the `client`
   folder. Or run `gulp watchify` if you plan to edit the client-side source.
12. Set up nginx to statically serve the `client` folder.

Contributing
